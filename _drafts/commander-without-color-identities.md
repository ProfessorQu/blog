## Introduction

My friends and I have made a few Commander decks with some unique twists. For example, we all created a deck where we could pick any card to be our commander. I made a {% card Tamanoa %} group slug deck and I love it to pieces. Anyway, now we've decided that it would be neat to create a deck where we remove the color identity rule of Commander. This rule states that the color identity of a card (which is it's color and any pips in it's textbox) must be within your Commander.

{% cards %}
![Syr Konrad, the Grim]
![Damn]
{% endcards %}

For example: if {% card Syr Konrad, the Grim %} is your commander you can run most black cards, but {%card Damn %} has white pips in its textbox so it's not allowed in the Syr Konrad deck. But, what if Damn was allowed? And what if cards that don't have any black in them are allowed? That is kind of the idea of this twist.

I want to go through a few commander that I think would become stronger with this twist, and perhaps some cards that are interesting that can go with it. There are a lot of commanders that are already in their best color for a certain effect or they have little to no extra synergies outside their normal color identity. These would still benefit from removing the color identity restriction, for example running {% card Cultivate %} in literally every single deck. But I just want to go through the unique changes and some thoughts that I have. With that, let's get started!

## Power Boost for Everyone

I wanted to go through a few cards that are just good almost no matter what the deck is. Basically, cards that are staples and can't be run by every deck due to the color identity restrictions but now they can!

### White Cards

{% cards %}
![Swords to Plowshares]
![Generous Gift]
![Teferi's Protection]
![Smothering Tithe]
{% endcards %}

For most of these I expect to look at the [top cards in that color on EDHRec](https://edhrec.com/top/white). Anyway, white allows access to some good removal spells, like {%card Swords to Plowshares %} and {%card Generous Gift %}. Or, on the other side of the spectrum, some really good protection in the form of {%card Teferi's Protection %}. And one card that is also very popular and very strong is {%card Smothering Tithe %}.

### Blue Cards

{% cards %}
![Counterspell]
![Fierce Guardianship]
![Cyclonic Rift]
![Rhystic Study]
{% endcards %}

Obviously, blue being blue, a few of the strongest, [most popular cards](https://edhrec.com/top/blue) are counterspells. Including {% card Counterspell %}! But {% card Fierce Guardianship %} is a very good counterspell too. And there is technically a strictly better counterspell than Counterspell, {% card Mana Drain %}, which is very powerful. Then we have the most powerful boardwipe in the EDH format, if you manage to cast it: {% card Cyclonic Rift %}. And then we have a hated card but also a very popular and powerful one too: {% card Rhystic Study %}, which can let you draw a lot of cards if your opponents are tax evaders.

### Black Cards

{% cards %}
![Dark Ritual]
![Village Rites]
![Reanimate]
![Demonic Tutor]
{% endcards %}

Black has some access to some powerful cards, like for example {% card Dark Ritual %}, one of the cards in the [Boon cycle](https://scryfall.com/search?q=otag%3Acycle-boon&unique=cards). {% card Village Rites %} is here more as a representative of all the cards in black that allow you to sacrifice your own creatures and other stuff for value, Village Rites just so happens to be a very powerful card with this type of effect. And after you've sacrificed your creatures (or milled/discarded) them, black is the color for {% card Reanimate %}-ing them. And if you want to look for a specific card, then black is your color because it has the most general tutors, like {% card Demonic Tutor %}.

### Red Cards

{% cards %}
![Blasphemous Act]
![Chaos Warp]
![Deflecting Swat]
![Lightning Bolt]
{% endcards %}

Red has a lot of cards that deal direct damage, for example {% card Blasphemous Act %} as a boardwipe or {% card Lightning Bolt %} for direct damage. There are a lot more cards that deal damage to either creatures or players, like [Impact Tremors](https://cards.scryfall.io/large/front/d/0/d0b7cecf-b51b-4d30-b7e9-cd7976271e07.jpg?1730572713) is also very popular.

## White

I'm getting all these commanders from [EDHRec](https://edhrec.com/), just picking a color and idly scrolling through the Commanders of that color until I find something that might be better without color restrictions. I want to almost immediately break one of the rules I set for myself to introduce another one! Apart from the commanders that become much stronger I also want to discuss the top commander of each color and for white that commander, at the time of writing, is {% card Giada, Font of Hope %}.

### Giada, Font of Hope

{% cards %}
![Giada, Font of Hope]
{% endcards %}

My first thought while looking at Giada is: I don't think this commander gets much better. Of course getting more support from all the other colors, ramp from green, removal from black, draw from blue, and extra aggro support from red, is extremely good. But the commander is already pretty strong and most other decks also gain this generic power boost. My second thought was [searching for angels we couldn't run before](https://scryfall.com/search?q=-id%3C%3Dw+t%3Aangel&unique=cards&as=grid&order=edhrec) and there are a few interesting ones.

#### Powerful Angels

{% cards %}
![Aurelia, the Warleader]
![Shalai, Voice of Plenty]
![Gisela, Blade of Goldnight]
![Sigarda, Font of Blessings]
{% endcards %}

We have a few very powerful angels. {% card Aurelia, the Warleader %} adding an extra combat could be game changing if you're attacking with a bunch of angels. {% card Shalai, Voice of Plenty %} is good protection for you and your board, {% card Gisela, Blade of Goldnight %} straight up doubles your damage output, and {% card Sigarda, Font of Blessings %} is actually a very good Angel typal card. All in all, nothing that is too crazy but certainly good. These next angels are more specifically for this deck.

#### Counter Synergy Angels

{% cards %}
![Atraxa, Praetors' Voice]
![Metropolis Angel]
![Shalai and Hallar]
{% endcards %}

{% card Atraxa, Praetors' Voice %} is a crazy card because your entire board just keeps growing, at every end step you can add a bunch of counters to a board that should already be full of counters. And an insane blocker and attacker of course. {% card Metropolis Angel %} is also pretty good: getting to draw a card on each attack. At first I thought that {% card Shalai and Hallar %} was crazy for this deck but actually, it's a nonbo. The counters aren't placed on the Angels, they enter with them on so Shalai and Hallar won't trigger from those sadly.

#### Typal Synergy

{% cards %}
![Kindred Discovery]
![Reflections of Littjara]
![Patriarch's Bidding]
![Raise the Palisade]
{% endcards %}

Some final cards I want to talk about, which are also good in any other Typal deck, are {% card Kindred Discovery %} allowing all your Angels to cantrip on enter and whenever they attack. This card can draw you a lot of cards. {% card Reflections of Littjara %} is crazy because doubling up on all your Angels can get out of hand really fast, because Giada also doesn't care whether it is a token or not this card is amazing and will allow so much more damage and synergy and counters. {% card Raise the Palisade %} is a very good typal boardwipe and {% card Patriarch's Bidding %} is a very good recursion spell for typal decks. As I said these cards are good in almost any typal deck so I won't mention them anymore but just know they are there.

### Light-Paw, Emperor's Voice

{% cards %}
![Light-Paws, Emperor's Voice]
{% endcards %}

{% card Light-Paws, Emperor's Voice %} is the second-most popular mono-white commander at the time of writing but I thought she would get a pretty cool boost so I thought I would mention some cards and interactions that might be interesting. First of all, and I didn't know this, but I was wondering what happened with her ability if you searched for a card that doesn't enchant a creature? It turns out, it doesn't attach and juts stays in your library. Which makes a lot of sense but still handy to know if you're building a deck for her or playing an already-built deck.

#### One-mana Auras

{% cards %}
![Wild Growth]
![Rancor]
![Kaya's Ghostform]
![Curiosity]
{% endcards %}

I was looking through [Auras that are now allowed](https://scryfall.com/search?q=t%3Aaura&unique=cards&as=grid&order=edhrec) and a few caught my eye. These cards are good on their own but getting to combine them is even better. {% card Wild Growth %} for example, has a neat interaction where you ramp, and you can get a creature aura for Light-Paws. {% card Rancor %} can help get through blockers, {% card Kaya's Ghostform %} is good protection from removal and {% card Curiosity %} is a nice reward for when you do manage to hit your opponents. But, one thing that all these Auras have in common is that they can get {% card Ethereal Armor %}, an incredibly good card for an Aura deck and very powerful.

#### Other Auras

{% cards %}
![Bear Umbra]
![Ancestral Mask]
![Strong Back]
{% endcards %}

And, apart from the normal upgrades, there are also a few auras that really help, most of which are in green so I guess even just adding green to Light-Paws would have made her a lot stronger. {% card Bear Umbra %} is very good because it is both protection and incredibly good ramp, while {% card Ancestral Mask %} can pump a creature a lot and {% card Strong Back %} can pump Light-Paws and make it a lot easier to enchant her with more Auras.

### Others

{% cards %}
![Elesh Norn, Mother of Machines]
![Delney, Streetwise Lookout]
![Gandalf the White]
![Darien, King of Kjeldor]
{% endcards %}

Some other mono white commanders I thought were interesting are {% card Elesh Norn, Mother of Machines %} with some [ETB effects](https://scryfall.com/search?q=otag%3Acreaturefall+-id%3C%3Dw&unique=cards&as=grid&order=edhrec) like {% card Impact Tremors %} or {% card The Great Henge %} or perhaps {% card Guardian Project %}.

{% card Delney, Streetwise Lookout %} can also become more powerful. There are a lot of [powerful creatures that have power 2 or less](https://scryfall.com/search?q=-id%3C%3Dw+power%3C%3D2+o%3Awhen&unique=cards&as=grid&order=edhrec) like {% card Beast Whisperer %} or allowing {% card Scute Swarm %} to go even faster. Perhaps some sacrifice strategies could be construed with {% card Blood Artist %} or {% card Zulaport Cutthroat %}.

{% card Gandalf the White %} can greatly make use of blue's artifact support with cards like {% card Etherium Sculptor %}, {% card Emry, Lurker of the Loch %} and {% card Urza, Lord High Artificer %}. Or use red's synergy with artifacts to deal damage, like with {% card Reckless Fireweaver %} and similar cards.

Finally {% card Darien, King of Kjeldor %}, I chose this card because I thought it might have some crazy combo potential. I looked through [Commander Spellbook](https://commanderspellbook.com/search/?q=card%3A%22Darien%2C+King+of+Kjeldor%22+-ci%3Awhite) and some cards that keep popping up are of course the [Soul Sisters](https://scryfall.com/search?q=otag%3Asoul-warden-ability&order=edhrec&unique=cards) who all allow you to gain all your life back that you lost with Darien out. But if you add a {% card Terror of the Peaks %}-like effect, then you could make infinite tokens, wait a turn and you win. Or use something else to win, like two Terror of the Peaks-like effects. I'm sure there are a lot more things you could do but this is just what I found while just casually looking.

## Blue

### Urza, Lord High Artificer

{% cards %}
![Urza, Lord High Artificer]
{% endcards %}

I don't want to talk a lot about {% card Urza, Lord High Artificer %} because Urza is already in it's best color and there is not a lot that the other colors offer him except for the default power boost.

{% cards %}
![Dispatch]
![Reckless Fireweaver]
![Hellkite Tyrant]
![Jhoira, Weatherlight Captain]
{% endcards %}

First of all, Urza gains access to a very good removal spell for their deck: {% card Dispatch %}. Getting to exile something for one mana because if you don't have three artifacts on the board at all times as an Urza player, you're doing it wrong. {% card Reckless Fireweaver %} is a good effect if you're throwing down a lot of artifacts but I don't think you can just throw it in any Urza deck, you'd have to build around it at least a little bit. {% card Hellkite Tyrant %} is good because you could win with his last line and stealing your opponents' artifacts is very oppressive. And {% card Jhoira, Weatherlight Captain %} is absolutely crazy. With just Jhoira and Urza each artifact cantrips and instantly taps for one blue mana. That could lead to an enormous storm turn, especially if there is a {% card Foundry Inspector %} or similar out.

### Braids, Conjurer Adept

{% cards %}
![Braids, Conjurer Adept]
{% endcards %}

Now, {% card Braids, Conjurer Adept %} is quite a fun card, I should know as I made a deck with it. There are a bunch of very powerful creatures that would absolutely love to be in a Braids deck.

#### ETBs

{% cards %}
![Apex Altisaur]
![Ghalta, Stampede Tyrant]
![Atraxa, Grand Unifier]
![Terastodon]
{% endcards %}

I'd like to look at some ETB effects. {% card Apex Altisaur %} for example is just straight up a 10/10 beater but can also destroy a ton of creatures when it enters by constantly fighting until death or until you've decided it's enough. {% card Ghalta, Stampede Tyrant %} is very strong if you can put it down with Braids because you can then empty your hand of the rest of the creatures. {% card Atraxa, Grand Unifier %} is great card advantage and a very good body with a lot of keywords. {% card Terastodon %} can even destroy whatever your opponents throw down if their cards are noncreatures and otherwise just remove the three greatest threats or remove nothing and it's just a vanilla 9/9.

#### Powerful Creatures

{% cards %}
![Absolute Virtue]
![Avacyn, Angel of Hope]
![Progenitus]
![Koma, Cosmos Serpent]
{% endcards %}

Then we have some very powerful creatures, like {% card Absolute Virtue %} which makes it very hard for our opponent to do anything to us as all damage from them is prevented. {% card Avacyn, Angel of Hope %} makes all our stuff indestructible so we can attack or block without any problems and is just an overall very powerful card. A card that Braids can only dream of, {% card Progenitus %} just can't be stopped once it hit that is just a 4 turn clock for someone you choose, can't be stopped or removed. It's a crazy card that doesn't guarantee a win but certainly helps you getting there. And {% card Koma, Cosmos Serpent %} is also an insanely powerful card, being able to pump out a ton of tokens and using those to protect Koma.


#### Artifacts

{% cards %}
![The Great Henge]
![Parhelion II]
![Bolas's Citadel]
{% endcards %}

Braids can put more stuff on the board than just creatures: lands! I'm kidding, those are not very useful as you can play those anyway, but there are a few powerful artifacts. Most powerful artifacts are colorless so this is not one of the categories that gets much more powerful, like creatures. But it's still very strong. Like {% card The Great Henge %} which you could also play after getting some strong creatures but if you don't have those yet you can prepare for them with The Great Henge. {% card Parhelion II %} is a very strong vehicle that is often cheated out in {% card Greasefang, Obika Boss %} decks and the two Angels it generates make it very powerful. And {% card Bolas's Citadel %} is a favourite of mine but also very strong if you can cheat it out and then pay a bunch of life for a bunch of big creatures.
