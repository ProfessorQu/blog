This is the final book in the series. It wraps everything up from all the previous books. This is the only book were the writer tries to convince the reader that Alcatraz is a hero, that is because this one is written by Bastille.

## Romance

First things first, this book has romance, which I don't really care for. Everyone kind of expected that Alcatraz and Bastille would end up together and if this book didn't confirm it I would assume every fan would ship them. At the end of the book there is an epilogue where they actually get married. I think it's fine, it's a bit weird compared to the other books but I think it's pretty well done.

## Story

Anyway, Attica got changed into a lens and Bibloden is trying to send energy into every Free Kingdomer, the same energy that powers Oculatory Lenses and the same power that the Smedrys have too much of, and that's why they gave themselves the Talents. To funnel off that power. Alcatraz and Bastille use a pair of Windstormer's Lenses to fly across the world and Alcatraz can reach out to his Talent a bit to break their flight path to go way faster and reach the Worldspire before Bibloden. This fails however and they land close-by on an island. It is the same island they crash-landed the Dragonaut on in [Alcatraz versus the Scrivener's Bones]({% post_url 2024-11-01-alcatraz-versus-the-scrivener-s-bones %}) and Alcatraz uses the extra power he now has because of the Talents he broke to fly the broken Dragonaut to the Worldspire.

## Oculator's Duel

When they arrive they fight off some Librarians, Alcatraz even fights a Dark Oculator in an Oculator dual. Alcatraz uses the Slantviewer's Lenses to send all the Oculatory power the Dark Oculator, named Etna, is sending to him back. This is overwhelming for them both and they get send off off the Worldspire down to their death.

Alcatraz breaks gravity. Yeah, his Talent breaks gravity so that he and Bastille don't die. Everywhere in the world, gravity is broken for a little bit. Those in the Hushlands can't remember this because of the Librarian memory toads. Because there is no gravity the sharks in the water start to rise up and try to eat Alcatraz and Bastille. To fix gravity, Alcatraz has to apologize to his Talent and after he does all the Smedry talents return.

## Final Showdown

When they finally get back up the Worldspire after sharing a kiss they find that Bibloden is there with a few Librarians. He gave these Librarians Talents and Bastille fights them and uses all the Talents against them masterfully because she fantasizes about fighting the Smedrys a lot. She uses the Librarians that can't do math to get some rope and she does a few other things to fight them off.

After they finally defeat Bibloden Alcatraz manages to make people not blow up by using the Blood-Forged Lens with Attica's soul in it to send all the energy that would vaporize all the Free Kingdomers to everyone and give them a small Smedry Talent, something that they could just ascribe to clumsiness or awkwardness, nowhere near as impactful as full Talents.

## Final Thoughts

All in all an incredible series and it is a great shame that this is the only content (so far!) that is released. I really hope Sanderson writes more or someone else gets the rights to create more. Books, comic boos, movies, who cares (as long as they are good). It is really just a way to escape from reality for a bit and I love it. This is probably **my favorite book series**.
