Part 4 of the book series! I swear all these books are amazing they are so easy to read that they just roll of the tongue but for reading books. I don't know why I love these books so much but I just do! This book is also amazing the commentary is always well-timed and funny. The commentary really makes these books, Alcatraz's random side tangents and everything are absolutely amazing.

## Introduction

*Alcatraz versus the Shattered Lens* as I said, is an amazing book. The book starts where [*Alcatraz versus the Knights of Crystallia*]({% post_url 2024-11-02-alcatraz-versus-the-knights-of-crystallia %}) left off. Alcatraz is in Nalhalla and they hear that Tuki-Tuki, a Mokian settlement is in danger. After hearing this Alcatraz escapes Nalhalla to go there so that the Knights of Crystallia are forced to follow him and try to defend Tuki-Tuki.

## Mokians

Mokians are an interesting folk, in the way that they don't even have a prison because they are a people of scholars. So instead of a discussion escalating into a fist fight it escalates into a debate. This is also reflected in the weapons they use: spears that shoot coma-inducing blasts. The Librarians also induce comatose surprisingly, this is because it is a more civilized way to fight and as an added bonus the other soldiers have to care for the all the fallen. The coma patients aren't dead but that means they have to be kept alive, while those patients can't do anything to help win the war.

## Arrival

After arriving at the settlement they see what they are up against, a few Librarian robots and a lot of Librarians. These are from the order of the Shattered Lens (Wow! What a surprise). They hate everything about the special types of glasses and Lenses and they especially hate Oculators. They handle most of the war against the Free Kingdoms because the other orders want them away, but after the Free Kingdom is defeated there will very likely be a civil war.

## Grenades (but cute ones)

After getting to the settlement Alcatraz has to hold out until the Knights come. He uses the Talent of his niece Aydee Ecks, who is bad at math, to get more bear grenades. Using these grenades they manage to take out all the Librarian robots that are hurling rocks at the glass dome protecting Tuki-Tuki. There are multiple types of explosive bear grenades, an explosion, an implosion, and something that vaporizes everything. Although each of those don't hurt any living things the explosion and implosion are still able to knock people about.

## Style

The thing that the author is trying to convince us in this book, whereas in [*Alcatraz versus the Evil Librarians*]({% post_url 2024-10-28-alcatraz-versus-the-evil-librarians %}) he tried to prove how he's not a good person and in [*Alcatraz versus the Scrivener's Bones*]({% post_url 2024-11-01-alcatraz-versus-the-scrivener-s-bones %}) he tries to show us that he is a liar and in [*Alcatraz versus the Knights of Crystallia*]({% post_url 2024-11-02-alcatraz-versus-the-knights-of-crystallia %}) he tries to prove he is awesome. In *Alcatraz versus the Shattered Lens* he tries to convince the reader that he's an idiot. He does this by misspelling 'stupid' as 'stoopid' in the entire book and mentioning how stupid he is every now and then. I like this kind of writing style, I think the author is really fleshed out this way and it seems like they are taking you by the hand through the entirety of the book.

## Final Thoughts

All in all, again a brilliant book where it is really surprising to me that this series is not more popular than it is. Each and every book just has a lot of character to it and sarcasm to match. I can't wait to read the fifth book and I have to still get the sixth one but that one is completely new I've never read *Bastille versus the Evil Librarians*.
