I liked the book quite a bit. I read most of it in a single day because I was procrastinating studying for my exams. I think it is weaker than Mistborn but still quite enjoyable.

## Aons

There is this city called Elantris that is situated in Arelon. It's inhabitants can draw Aons in anything to draw forth incredible power. However after a monumental earthquake the Aons stopped working and all Elantrians became weak and sickly instead of their former godlike might. I liked the reveal that the Chasm was the source of all the Elantrians problems and that the Elantrians were somehow created from a giant Aon involving the Elantris and the cities around Elantris. A magic system that works with the landscape and can fail or work depending on changes in the landscape is quite an interesting concept. I do wonder though: who created the Aon that gives people the Shaod? It wasn't Elantrians because they existed because of the Shaod, or maybe there was some sort of primal Elantrians who knew that they would have to keep their race and the prosper they bring going. Not out of arrogance as the 10 years the Reod was a thing didn't do Arelon any good.

## Hrathen

_Hrathen_

I liked his character a lot, as from his point of view we can really begin to see how he tries desperately to convert everyone in Arelon. It makes sense because he thinks that if they convert they will be saved by Jaddath. His intentions are good but he is still made out to be evil because he, well, toppled a nation and started a bloody revolution in Duralen. I think his struggles with faith are also quite interesting. Unsure of whether he preaches because of his belief or because of his logic.

## Conclusion

I think it's pretty good although I am kind of dissapointed by Hrathen's betrayel, it was poorly foreshadowed in my opinion. I could tell that this was Sanderson's first book but that did not make it bad. I still read the entire thing in almost one sitting so I can't complain about it too much.
