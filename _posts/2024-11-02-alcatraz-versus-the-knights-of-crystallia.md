I'm already at the third book, I know, I know. I'm amazing and a very fast reader. You may think that that is a weird thing to mention, but it is relevant I swear! In this book Alcatraz tries to prove to us how he's not a hero by constantly mentioning how amazing he is. This one is, again, a really great and funny book.

The book is all about Nalhalla, one of the parts of the Free Kingdom. Probably one of the most important parts as there resides a lot of very important people like the Smedrys, the Knights of Crystallia and some other powerful royalty. You see, before the Librarians took over a large part of the world, there were a lot of separate kingdoms. The Librarians started gaining power and taking over these tiny kingdoms. Therefore, the remaining kingdoms banded together and formed the Free Kingdoms, which includes Nalhalla a Mokia and others which I can't recall. It takes part in Alcatraz getting used to being in Nalhalla and getting used to their customs, getting acquainted with some more people.

They uncover a Librarian conspiracy to steal a book about the Smedry Talents, who are more related to Oculatory and similatics than everything thinks they are. Alcatraz gives a few examples like the Disguiser's Lenses and Australia's ability to wake up ugly. The conspiracy helps them to stop a treaty that would have signed Mokia over to the Librarians in return for peace, but after the members of the council figure out about the conspiracy to steal the books and they inadvertently kidnapped the prince, they decide to not sign the treaty.

To be honest, I don't know why there are just 6 books of this. This is amazing content and should be made into a film or multiple. Or a series, or comic books would be incredibly cool. Basically I need more Alcatraz. But for now I'm not done! There are still 3 more books: Alcatraz versus the Shattered Lens, Alcatraz versus the Evil Librarians: The Dark Talent and Bastille versus the Evil Librarians. I can't wait to read all of them!
