This book was quite fun to read. I read it quite fast, maybe a bit too fast but the plot twists were pretty good. Sanderson keeps amazing me with how he builds worlds that are just interesting and managing to give just enough to want to learn more.

## Betrayal

_Denth and Tonk Fah_

The twist with Denth being not very good at all was quite good. I liked how it was hinted that he had a darker side to him, but they seemed to friendly. Tonk Fah maiming and killing his pets also makes so much sense but is terrifying. I'm not sure if they forbade her from going down into the basement but they did warn her about the steps. I was completely blindsided to be honest. I still have no clue why Denth wanted to start a war, perhaps just to antogonize Vasher so he might be able to catch him. There's so much history and lore revealed just at the very end of the book and I'm so curious about what it is all about.

## The God King

_The God King (Susebron)_

This was also very well done I would say. The God King being very child-like makes a lot of sense when it is revealed. Basically cut off from anyone other than his priests and having no tongue will do that to a person I would assume. And it were the Pahn Kahl, the opressed group that wanted all this to happend all along. It made a lot of sense but I feel that it could have been foreshadowed better. But maybe that's just a wrong impression I had. Bluefingers was the character that started the doubts in Siri about the God King's priests. The romance between the Susebron and Siri was also very well construed. It felt natural and made sense in my head.

## Lightsong

_Lightsong and Blushweaver_

Lightsong is probably my favorite character from this book, his humor is of the highest order. Him doubting the religion and then the eventual reveal that Scoot, his high priest was his brother before he Returned? *Chef's kiss*. For the entirety of the Book Llarimar was constantly in control of his emotions and then at the end he snapped. Finally done with all of Lightsong's shenanigans. I like that Lightsong was a big part in deciding whether to attack Idris and deciding not to, but I dislike how he was relegated to just someone there to heal the God King's tongue. It was great don't get me wrong but I think he deserved better, I don't know what but this just felt unsatisfactory. Him giving up his life for the God King, a person who he has never actually interacted with and knows nothing about except that he is the god of gods for a religion he didn't believe in until just a few seconds ago. Ah maybe that's just me being nitpicky.

## Conclusion

I liked the book quite a lot. I did find it sometimes a bit weird but maybe that's just because I read it a bit fast and inconsistently. I'm still trying to figure out how to read books to make them fun to read. I think that the **Stormlight Archive** is probably next, but I guess you'll figure out yourself what the next book will be.
