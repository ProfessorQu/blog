I followed a [Getting Started tutorial](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/getting-started/) written by the wonderful people that work on Chirpy. I decided to use this as a basis because I thought it would be fun to start my own blog and Chirpy seemed easy to setup and start writing with.
For this blog I've decided that I will write here what I want to write, whether it is about technical stuff, books, my day-to-day life, math or anything else I can come up with, I'll write about it if I want to and no-one can stop me! 
This blog is not really intended for anyone else to read, but if someone finds this, I'm more than happy to accommodate you!

Everything went smoothly until I wanted to change the favicon. There was a tutorial ([Customize the Favicon](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/customize-the-favicon/)) for it didn't seem to change after multiple attempts at using the [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) they gave, after some looking around through the files of the blog, I found that the `_site` folder had a `android-chrome-192x192.png` image but that wasn't made with the Real Favicon Generator. So after trying to use [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) it generated images and after putting those in the `/assets/img/favicons` folder it worked!

After this setup, I then obviously wanted to create a new blog post. To do this I used [Jekyll Compose](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-compose) as recommended by Chirpy's [Writing a New Post](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/write-a-new-post/) tutorial. I used this to create a draft and then publish it, all very self-explanatory to be honest.

This is a short blog post, but expect more rants and deranged or interesting posts later. Or I might abondon this blog after this post, who knows?
